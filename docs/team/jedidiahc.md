### Project: Le Tracker

For fast typist NUS students who need a fun way to organise and track lecture material, Le Tracker is a gamified
tracking application that allows them to easily log their lecture progress, search for lecture by mod code/ keywords/
topics for a stress-free learning environment. Unlike todo list applications, Le Tracker is tailored to the needs of
students; it provides additional information specific to lecture media such as watch progress and topics.
