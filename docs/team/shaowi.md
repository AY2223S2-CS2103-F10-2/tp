### Project: LE TRACKER

LE TRACKER is a gamified tracking application that allows fast typist to easily log their lecture progress, search for lecture by mod code/ keywords/ topics for a stress-free learning environment. Unlike todo list applications, LE TRACKER is tailored to the needs of students; it provides additional information specific to lecture media such as watch progress and topics.
