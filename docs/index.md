**Le Tracker** is a desktop application that focuses on tracking the watch progress of lectures, and is designed specifically to meet the needs of students.

Unlike a traditional to-do list app, **Le Tracker** offers additional features that are tailored to the educational context, such as the ability to track the number of videos watched and the timestamp of each video. This extra information can help students stay organized and keep track of their progress more effectively.

While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

- If you are interested in using **Le Tracker**, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
- If you are interested about developing **Le Tracker**, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
