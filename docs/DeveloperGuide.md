### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete CS2040S`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="733" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="288" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="611" />

\*\* This class diagram omits some classes and dependencies in the `Model` component for the purpose of simplicity (classes excluded include `ModuleCode`, `ModuleName`, `LectureName`, `VideoName`, `Tag` and other classes)

The `Model` component,

- stores the tracker data i.e., all `Module` objects which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object, along with the `Lecture` objects contained in the `UniqueLectureList` objects of said `Module` objects, as well as the `Video` objects contained in the `UniqueVideoList` objects of said `Lecture` objects.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate *filteredModules* list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Lecture` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate *filteredLectures* list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Lecture>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Video` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate *filteredVideos* list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Video>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- <!-- TODO: Include details on Navigation @jedidiahC -->TODO: Navigation
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="617" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both tracker data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `TrackerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add module, lecture, and video feature

The `add` command supports:

- Adding a `Module` object to the `Tracker` object contained in the `ModelManager` object
- Adding a `Lecture` object to a `Module` object contained in the `Tracker` object
- Adding a `Video` object to a `Lecture` object contained in a `Module` object that is contained in the `Tracker` object

It's behaviour is dependent on the user's input.

**Notable Classes**

- `AddCommandParser` – Creates the appropriate `AddCommand` subclass object base on the user's input
- `AddCommand` – Base class of any `Command` subclass that handles adding some entity to the `Tracker` object
- `AddModuleCommand` – Subclass of `AddCommand` which handles adding a `Module` object to the `Tracker` object
- `AddLectureCommand` – Subclass of `AddCommand` which handles adding a `Lecture` object to a `Module` object
- `AddVideoCommand` – Subclass of `AddCommand` which handles adding a `Video` object to a `Lecture` object

**Execution**

The following sequence diagram depicts an `add` command execution for adding a `Module` object to the `Tracker` object.

<img src="images/AddSequenceDiagram.png" width="979"/>

**Notes for `AddCommandParser#parse(String)`**

- The string passed in contains the arguments in the user's input and is use to determine the intent of the command as well as the appropriate subclass of `AddCommand` to create an object for. The following table describes how the intent is determined base on the arguments provided in the user's input. Any combination of arguments not described in the table will result in a `ParseException` object being thrown and the command will not be executed.

  | Has preamble | Has `/mod` argument | Has `/lec` argument |        Intent        | `AddCommand` subclass |
  | :----------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------: |
  |     Yes      |         No          |         No          | Add `Module` object  |  `AddModuleCommand`   |
  |     Yes      |         Yes         |         No          | Add `Lecture` object |  `AddLectureCommand`  |
  |     Yes      |         Yes         |         Yes         |  Add `Video` object  |   `AddVideoCommand`   |

- The argument values are checked for their validity by using the appropriate methods in the `ParserUtil` class. If any of the values are invalid, a `ParserException` object will be thrown and the command will not be executed.

**Notes for `AddCommand#execute()`**

- A `CommandException` object can be thrown for the following scenarios:
  - The `Module`/`Lecture`/`Video` object is the same as another existing `Module`/`Lecture`/`Video` object according to `Module#isSameModule(Module)`/`Lecture#isSameLecture(Lecture)`/`Video#isSameVideo(Video)`.
  - The `Module` object which a `Lecture` object is being added to does not exist.
  - The `Module` object which a `Lecture` object is specified to be in does not exist.
  - The `Lecture` object which a `Video` object is being added to does not exist.

### Edit module, lecture, and video feature

The `edit` command supports:

- Editing the details of a `Module` object in the `Tracker` object contained in the `ModelManager` object
- Editing the details of a `Lecture` object belonging to a `Module` object contained in the `Tracker` object
- Editing the details of a `Video` object belonging to a `Lecture` object contained in a `Module` object that is contained in the `Tracker` object

It's behaviour is dependent on the user's input.

**Notable Classes**

- `EditCommandParser` – Creates the appropriate `EditCommand` subclass object base on the user's input
- `EditCommand` – Base class of any `Command` subclass that handles editing some entity of the `Tracker` object
- `EditModuleCommand` – Subclass of `EditCommand` which handles editing the details of a `Module` object belonging to the `Tracker` object
- `EditLectureCommand` – Subclass of `EditCommand` which handles editing the details of a `Lecture` object belonging to a `Module` object
- `EditVideoCommand` – Subclass of `EditCommand` which handles editing the details of a `Video` object belonging to a `Lecture` object

**Execution**

The following sequence diagram depicts an `edit` command execution for editing the name of a `Module` object in the `Tracker` object.

<img src="images/EditSequenceDiagram.png" width="998"/>

**Notes for `EditCommandParser#parse(String)`**

- The string passed in contains the arguments in the user's input and is use to determine the intent of the command as well as the appropriate subclass of `EditCommand` to create an object for. The following table describes how the intent is determined base on the arguments provided in the user's input. Any combination of arguments not described in the table will result in a `ParseException` object being thrown and the command will not be executed.

  | Has preamble | Has `/mod` argument | Has `/lec` argument |        Intent         | `EditCommand` subclass |
  | :----------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------: |
  |     Yes      |         No          |         No          | Edit `Module` object  |  `EditModuleCommand`   |
  |     Yes      |         Yes         |         No          | Edit `Lecture` object |  `EditLectureCommand`  |
  |     Yes      |         Yes         |         Yes         |  Edit `Video` object  |   `EditVideoCommand`   |

- The argument values are checked for their validity by using the appropriate methods in the `ParserUtil` class. If any of the values are invalid, a `ParserException` object will be thrown and the command will not be executed.

- If no arguments related to updated fields are provided, a `ParseException` object will be thrown and the command will not be executed.

**Notes for `EditCommand#execute()`**

- A `CommandException` object can be thrown for the following scenarios:
  - The edited `Module`/`Lecture`/`Video` object is the same as another `Module`/`Lecture`/`Video` object according to `Module#isSameModule(Module)`/`Lecture#isSameLecture(Lecture)`/`Video#isSameVideo(Video)`.
  - The `Module` object which a `Lecture` object is specified to be in does not exist.
  - The `Lecture` object which a `Video` object is specified to be in does not exist.

### Delete module, lecture, and video feature

The `delete` command supports:

- Deleting a single specified module.
- Deleting a single specified lecture under a specified module context.
- Deleting a single specified video under a specified module and specified lecture context.
- Deleting multiple specified modules / lectures / videos under the respective specified contexts mentioned in the above points.
  - E.g.: User wishes to delete a module CS2040S.\
     Executing `delete CS2040S` would allow the user to do so, unless the module does not exist, in which case, Le Tracker will throw an error.
  - E.g.: User wishes to delete multiple modules CS2107, ST2334 AND CS3230\
     Executing `delete CS2107, ST2334, CS3230` will allow the user to do so. If either module does not exist, nothing is deleted and Le Tracker will throw an error.

This feature's behaviour is dependent on the arguments provided by the user, as well as by the state of Le Tracker.

**Implementation Details**

The feature utilises the following classes:

- `DeleteCommandParser`: parses the arguments appropriately for the appropriate `DeleteCommand` to be returned to be executed
- `DeleteCommand`: Abstract class extending from `Commands` for commands that delete a specified entity from the tracker
- `DeleteModuleCommand`: Subclass of `DeleteCommand` which handles the deletion a module from the tracker
- `DeleteLectureCommand`: Subclass of `DeleteCommand` which handles the deletion a lecture from a module in the tracker
- `DeleteVideoCommand`: Subclass of `DeleteCommand` which handles the deletion a video from a lecture from a module in the tracker.
- `DeleteMultipleCommand`: Abstract class extending from `DeleteCommand` for delete commands that delete multiple specified entities from the tracker
- `DeleteMultipleModulesCommand`: Subclass of `DeleteMultipleCommand` which handles the deletion of multiple modules from the tracker
- `DeleteMultipleLecturesCommand`: Subclass of `DeleteMultipleCommand` which handles the deletion of multiple lectures from the same module in the tracker
- `DeleteMultipleVideosCommand`: Subclass of `DeleteMultipleCommand` which handles the deletion of multiple videos from the same lecture in the same module in the tracker.
- `MultipleEventsParser`: Interface that parses string for commands that can be executed on multiple objects at once

The following diagram shows the Class Diagram of the `DeleteCommand` hierarchy:

![DeleteCommandClassDiagram](images/delete/deleteCommandClassDiagram.png)

The following diagram shows the Sequence Diagram of executing a `DeleteMultipleModulesCommand`:

![DeleteMultpleModulesCommandSequential](images/delete/DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

The following is a description of the code execution flow

1. `DeleteCommandParser#parse(String)` takes the user's input as a `String` argument and determines the intention of the command (delete module, lecture or video).
   The following table below depicts the consideration of inputs against the user's argument:

   | Has Preamble | has `/mod` argument | has `/lec` agrgument | Intent        |
   | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
   | Yes          | No                  | No                   | Delete Module |
   | Yes          | Yes                 | No                   | DeleteLecture |
   | Yes          | Yes                 | Yes                  | DeleteVideo   |

2. The argument values are then checked on as such:

   - ModuleCode: valid mod code that begins with capital letters, followed by numbers. could end with capital letters at the end
   - LectureName: valid lecture name that does not contain symbols
   - VideoName: valid lecture name that does not contain symbols

   Note: LectureName and VideoName should not contain commas (","). Rather than throwing as errors, Le Tracker will treat it as though the user intended to delete multiple entities

3. The appropriate `DeleteCommand` subclass object is created then returned to its caller.

4. If no exceptions are thrown, Le Tracker has successfully maanged to delete the specified module/lecture/video from itself

**Reasons for such implementation**

1. Adhering to Open-Close Principle: Open for Extension, Closed for Modification.
2. Having abstract classes to group multiple commands together allows for adherance of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in cases such as `DeleteCommand.COMMAND_WORD` in every class

**Alternatives considered**

1. Combine all featured classes into one large single class
   - Pros:
     - all file content in one single place
     - easily adheres to DRY since there would be no need to repeat information across multiple files
   - Cons:
     - violates Open-Close Principle
     - creates a large file that needs to be edited. Hard to search through

**Possible further implementation**

- encapsulate conditional checks in each delete command execution
- capture the essence of DeleteMultipleModulesCommand in DeleteModuleCommand
- capture the essence of DeleteMultipleLecturesCommand in DeleteLectureCommand
- capture the essence of DeleteMultipleVideosCommand in DeleteVideoCommand

### Mark / UnMark video feature

The `mark` command supports:

- Marking unmarked videos as watched
- Marking marked videos as unwatched
- Marking multiple videos in 1. and 2.
  - E.g.: User wishes to mark multile videos "Vid 1, Vid 2" in lecture "Week 1" of module "CS2040S" as watched.\
    Executing `mark Vid 1, Vid 2 /mod CS2040S /lec Week 1` would allow the user to do so, unless either one of the following conditions are true:
    1. the module (CS2040S) does not exist in the Tracker
    2. the lecture (Week 1) does not exist in the module (CS2040S)
    3. either of the videos (Vid 1, Vid 2) does not exist in the lecture of the module (CS2040S > Week 1)
    4. either of the videos (Vid 1, Vid 2) has already been marked as watched
  - E.g.: User wishes to mark multiple videos "Vid 3", "Vid 4" and "Lecture Summary" in lecture "Topic 4" of module "ST2334" as unwatched.\
    Executing `unmark Vid 3, Vid 4, Lecture Summary /mod ST2334 /lec Topic 1` would allow the user to do so, unless either one of the following conditions are true:
    1. the module (ST2334) doese not exist in the Tracker
    2. the lecture (Topic 1) does not exist in the module (ST2334)
    3. either of the videos (Vid 3, Vid 4, Lecture Summary) does not exist in the lecture of the module (ST2334 > Topic 1)
  - E.g.: User wishes to mark a single video "Vid 1" in lecture "Topic 4" of module "ST2334" as unwatched.\
    Executing `unmark Vid 1 /mod ST2334 /lec Topic 4` would allow the user to do so, unless either one of the following conditions are true:
    1. the module (ST2334) does not exist in the Tracker
    2. the lecture (Topic 4) does not exist in the module (ST2334)
    3. the video (Vid 1) is already unmarked
    4. the video (Vid 1) does not exist in the lecture of the module (ST2334 > Topic 4)

This feature's behaviour is dependent on the arguments provided by the user, as well as the state of Le Tracker.

Note the difference between mark multiple and unmark multiple. As of current implementation, unmark multiple does not alert the user if video was already unmarked. However, unmark a single video does.

**Implementation Details**

The feature utilises the following classes:

- `MarkCommand`: Abstract class extending from `Command` for commands that mark a specified video as watched or unwatched
- `MarkAsWatchedCommandParser`: parses arguments appropriately for `MarkAsWatchedCommand` to be returned to be executed
- `MarkAsWatchedCommand`: Subclass of `MarkCommand` which handles marking a video as watched. Can handle marking multiple videos as well
- `MarkAsUnwatchedCommandParser`: parses arguments appropriately for `MarkAsUnwatchedCommand` and `MarkMultipleAsUnwatchedCommand` to be returned to be executed
- `MarkAsUnwatchedCommand`: Subclass of `MarkCommand` which handles marking a video as unwatched
- `MarkMultipleAsUnwatchedCommand`: Subclass of `MarkCommand` which handles marking multiple videos as unwatched
- `MultipleEventsParser`: Interface that parses string for commands that can be executed on multiple objects at once

The following diagram shows the Sequence Diagram of executing a `MarkAsWatchedCommand`:

![MarkAsWatched](images/mark/MarkAsWatchedSequenceDiagram.png)

The following is a description of the code execution flow

1. `MarkAsWatchedCommandParser#parse(String)` / `MarkAsUnwatchedCommandParser#parse(String` takes the user's input as a `String` argument and determines the target video to be marked. The following table below depicts the command returned against the user's intent

   | Parser                         | Has Multiple Videos | Command                          |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | `MarkAsWatchedCommandParser`   | Yes / No              | `MarkAsWatchedCommand`           |
   | `MarkAsUnwatchedCommandParser` | Yes                 | `MarkAsUnwatchedCommand`         |
   | `MarkAsUnwatchedCommandParser` | No                  | `MarkMultipleAsUnwatchedCommand` |

2. The argument values are then checked on as such:

   - ModuleCode: valid module code that complies with the module code format
   - LectureName: valid lecture name that does not containt symbols
   - VideoName: valid lecture name that does not contain symbols

   Note: LectureName and VideoName should not contain commas (","). Rather than throwing errors, Le Tracker will treat it as though the user intended to delete multiple videos

3. The appropriate `MarkCommand` subclass object is created then returned to its caller

4. Upon execution, the argument values in the `MarkCommand` subclass object are then checked on as such:

   - ModuleCode: if module with ModuleCode exists in Le Tracker
   - LectureName: if lecture with LectureName exists in module ModuleCode
   - VideoName: if video(s) with VideoName exists in lecture LectureName of module ModuleCode and whether the video(s) is/are marked or unmarked (differs according to whether `mark` or `unmark` is called)

5. If no exceptions are thrown, Le Tracker has successfully managed to mark/unmark the specified video(s)

**Reasons for such implementation**

1. Adhering to Open-Close Principle: Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
2. Having abstract classes to group mark commands together allows for adherance of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in cases such as success message formats in every class

**Alternatives considered**

1. Combine all featured classes into one large single class
   Pros:
   - all file content in one single place
   - easily adheres to DRY since there would be no need to repeat information across multiple files
     Cons:
   - violates Open-Close Principle
   - creates a large file that needs to be edited. Hard to search through

**Possible further implementation**

- Update command result of `MarkMultipleAsUnwatchedCommand` to catch when this command is called when the videos are already marked as unwatched, similar to `MarkAsUnwatchedCommand` and `MarkAsWatchedCommand`
- Collate `MarkAsUnwatchedCommand` and `MarkMultipleAsUnwatchedCommand` into one class, similar to `MarkAsWatchedCommand`

### List module, lecture and video feature

The `list` command supports:

- Listing modules in the tracker
- Listing lectures in a module in the tracker
- Listing videos in a lecture which belongs to a module in the tracker

It's behaviour is dependent on the arguments provided by the user.

The feature utilises the following classes/variable:

- `ListCommandParser` – Creates the appropriate `ListCommand` subclass object base on the user's input
- `ListCommand` – Base class of any `Command` subclass that list some entity in the tracker
- `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MODULES` – Constant `Predicate` with type `ReadOnlyModule` that list all modules
- `LecturePredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `ReadOnlyLecture`
- `VideoPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `Video`

The following sequence diagram depicts a `list` command execution for listing lectures in a module in the tracker.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

![ListSequenceDiagramRefListLectures](images/ListSequenceDiagramRefListLectures.png)

The following is a description of the code execution flow:

1. `ListCommandParser#parse(String)` takes the user's input as an argument and determines the intent of the command as well as the appropriate subclass of `ListCommand` to create an object for. The following table describes how the intent is determined base on the arguments provided in the user's input. Any combination of inputs that do not comply with the combination of arguments specified in the table is considered an error and will result in a `ParseException` being thrown and the command will not be executed.

   In Root Context:

   | Has `/mod` argument | Has `/lec` argument | Intent        | `Predicate` tested           |
   | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
   | No                  | No                  | List modules  | `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MODULES` |
   | Yes                 | No                  | List lectures | `LecturePredicate`           |
   | Yes                 | Yes                 | List videos   | `VideoPredicate`             |

   In Module Context:

   | Has `/mod` argument | Has `/lec` argument | Intent        | `Predicate` tested |
   | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
   | No                  | No                  | List lectures | `LecturePredicate` |
   | Yes                 | No                  | List lectures | `LecturePredicate` |
   | No                  | Yes                 | List videos   | `VideoPredicate`   |
   | Yes                 | Yes                 | List videos   | `VideoPredicate`   |

   In Lecture Context:

   | Has `/mod` argument | Has `/lec` argument | Intent        | `Predicate` tested |
   | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
   | Yes                 | No                  | List lectures | `LecturePredicate` |
   | No                  | Yes/No              | List videos   | `VideoPredicate`   |
   | Yes                 | Yes                 | List videos   | `VideoPredicate`   |

   In All Context:

   | Has `/r` argument | Intent      | `Predicate` tested           |
   | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
   | Yes               | List module | `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MODULES` |

2. The argument values are then checked for their validity by using the appropriate methods in `ParserUtil`. If any of the values are invalid, a `ParserException` will be thrown and the command will not be executed.

3. The appropriate `ListCommand` subclass object is created and then returned to the caller.

4. `LogicManager` calls the `Command#execute(Model)` method of the `Command` object returned by `ListCommandParser#parse(String)`. During execution of the command, a `CommandException` can be thrown for the following scenarios:

   - The `Module` which `Lectures` are to be listed does not exist
   - The `Lecture` which `Videos` are to be listed does not exist

5. Note that extra arguments are ignored.\
   Examples:

   - `list /r foo` or `list bar /r` :arrow_right: `list /r`
   - `list bar /mod CS2040S` :arrow_right: `list /mod CS2040S`

6. If no errors occur (no exceptions are thrown), the command succeeds in listing the modules/lectures/videos.

### Find module, lecture and video feature

The `find` command supports:

- Finding a module in the tracker
  1. By module code and name
  2. By module tags
- Finding a lecture in a module in the tracker
  1. By lecture name
  2. By lecture tags
- Finding a video in a lecture which belongs to a module in the tracker
  1. By video name
  2. By video tags

It's behaviour is dependent on the arguments provided by the user.

The feature utilises the following classes:

- `FindCommandParser` – Creates the appropriate `FindCommand` subclass object base on the user's input
- `FindCommand` – Base class of any `Command` subclass that finds some entity in the tracker
- `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `ReadOnlyModule`
- `ModuleTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `ReadOnlyModule`
- `LectureNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `ReadOnlyLecture`
- `LectureTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `ReadOnlyLecture`
- `VideoNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `Video`
- `VideoTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` – Class that implements `Predicate` interface with type `Video`

The following sequence diagram depicts a `find` command execution for finding a module in the tracker.

Below is an activity diagram that showcase the event that occurs when find command is executed.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

The following is a description of the code execution flow:

1. `FindCommandParser#parse(String)` takes the user's input as an argument and determines the intent of the command as well as the appropriate subclass of `FindCommand` to create an object for. The following table describes how the intent is determined base on the arguments provided in the user's input. Any combination of inputs that do not comply with the combination of arguments specified in the table is considered an error and will result in a `ParseException` being thrown and the command will not be executed.

   | Yes          | Yes               | No                    | Find module | `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`    |
   | Yes          | Yes               | Yes                   | Find module | `ModuleTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` |

2. The argument values are then checked for their validity by using the appropriate methods in `ParserUtil`. If any of the values are invalid, a `ParserException` will be thrown and the command will not be executed.

3. The appropriate `FindCommand` subclass object is created and then returned to the caller.

4. `LogicManager` calls the `Command#execute(Model)` method of the `Command` object returned by `FindCommandParser#parse(String)`. During execution of the command, a `CommandException` can be thrown for the following scenarios:

   - The `Module` specified by user does not exist when listing `Lectures`
   - The `Lecture` of a `Module` or the `Module` specified by user does not exist when listing `Videos`

5. If no errors occur (no exceptions are thrown), the command succeeds in finding the module/lecture/video associated to the keyword.

### Navigation feature

> The navigation system was designed to eliminate the need for users to repeat the same /mod /lec arguments for multiple commands. This is based on the observation that users often make multiple commands from the same context (i.e. tracking a specific module or lecture).

Similar to the `cd` command which changes the current working directory in Unix-based systems, the navigation family of commands allows the user to navigate through the hierarchy to a specified module or lecture. Once the user has navigated to a context, they do not need to include the /mod or /lec arguments for commands related to the current context.

Instead, the navigation system will inject /mod /lec arguments into the user's command. Hence, commands will be able to infer the specified module or lecture from the current context without being directly coupled to the navigation system.

**Usage scenario**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the navigation system behaves at each step.

Steps:

1. The user launches the application. The Navigation system is initialized with the root context which has no module code or lecture name.

2. The user wants to navigate to the module CS2040S and executes the `nav CS2040S` command.

   ![FindActivityDiagram](images/NavSequenceDiagram0.png)

3. The user wants to navigate to the lecture Week 1 in the CS2040S context and executes the `nav Week 1` command.

4. The user wants to list the videos of the CS2040S/Week 1 context and executes `list` command.

### Tag module, lecture, and video feature

The `tag` command supports:

- Tagging a module in the tracker
- Tagging a lecture of a module in the tracker
- Tagging a video of a lecture which belongs to a module in the tracker

The `tag` behaviour is dependent on the arguments provided by the user. Modules, lectures, and videos can have
multiple, unique tags. If a command contains new tags and tags that were already added to modules, lectures, or
videos, only the new tags will be added.

The feature utilises the following classes:

- `TagCommandParser` – Creates the appropriate `TagCommand` subclass object based on the user's input
- `TagCommand` – Execute the command to add tags to a module, lecture, or video based on the user's input

The following is a description of the code execution flow:

1. `TagCommandParser#parse(String)` takes in the user input and determine whether the user wanted to tag a module,
   a lecture, or a video based on the appropriate prefixes included in the user's input.
2. The user input is then checked to determine whether it contains the required prefixes according to the table
   below. Any combination of inputs that do not satisfy the command's required prefixes will be considered an error.
   A `ParseException` will be thrown, and the command will not be executed.

   | Intent      | has `/mod` prefix | has `/lec` prefix | has `/vid` prefix | has `/tags` prefix |
   | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
   | Tag Module  | No                | No                | No                | Yes                |
   | Tag Lecture | Optional          | No                | No                | Yes                |
   | Tag Video   | Optional          | Optional          | No                | Yes                |

3. A set of tags to add is then determined from the user's input. Afterwards, The command creates an
   appropriate `TagCommand` object and returns it to the called.
4. `LogicManager` calls the `Command#execute(Model)` method of the `TagCommand` object returned by
   `TagCommandParser#parse (String)`. During the execution, a CommandException will be thrown if no tags were
   provided, or if the tracker doesn't contain the specified module, lecture, or video.
5. If no errors occur (no exceptions are thrown), the command succeeds in tagging the module, lecture, or video.

### Untag module, lecture, and video feature

The `untag` command supports:

- Removing tags from a module in the tracker
- Removing tags from a lecture of a module in the tracker
- Removing tags from a video of a lecture which belongs to a module in the tracker

The `untag` behaviour is dependent on the arguments provided by the user. Multiple tags can be deleted in a single
command. If a command contains nonexistent tags and tags that were already added to modules, lectures, or
videos, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

The feature utilises the following classes:

- `UntagCommandParser` – Creates the appropriate `UntagCommand` subclass object based on the user's input
- `UntagCommand` – Execute the command to remove tags from a module, lecture, or video based on the user's input

The following is a description of the code execution flow:

1. `UntagCommandParser#parse(String)` takes in the user input and determine whether the user wanted to untag a module,
   a lecture, or a video based on the appropriate prefixes included in the user's input.
2. The user input is then checked to determine whether it contains the required prefixes according to the table
   below. Any combination of inputs that do not satisfy the command's required prefixes will be considered an error.
   A `ParseException` will be thrown, and the command will not be executed.

   | Intent        | has `/mod` prefix | has `/lec` prefix | has `/vid` prefix | has `/tags` prefix |
   | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
   | Untag Module  | No                | No                | No                | Yes                |
   | Untag Lecture | Optional          | No                | No                | Yes                |
   | Untag Video   | Optional          | Optional          | No                | Yes                |

3. A set of tags to remove is then determined from the user's input. Afterwards, The command creates an
   appropriate `UntagCommand` object and returns it to the called.
4. `LogicManager` calls the `Command#execute(Model)` method of the `UntagCommand` object returned by
   `UntagCommandParser#parse (String)`. During the execution, a CommandException will be thrown if no tags were
   provided, if the tracker doesn't contain the specified module, lecture, or video, or if there are tags from the
   user input that doesn't exist in the module, lecture, or video.
5. If no errors occur (no exceptions are thrown), the command succeeds in removing the tags from the module, lecture,
   or video.

### Import archived data feature

**Reasons for such implementation**

- The user need to retrieved data when the user wants to review the concepts taught in a module,
  lecture, or video

### Exporting data feature

**Reasons for such implementation**

- The user need to save storage space after finished studying a module. The UI will also be less packed

### Clear feature

The `clear` feature supports clearing the entire tracker of all modules, lectures and videos

The feature utilises the following classes:
- `ClearCommand` - executable command to clear modules, lectures and videos in the tracker

The following is a description of the code execution flow:
1. `TrackerParser#parseCommand` parses based on the command word `clear` to identify that the Clear feature is being called.
2. `ClearCommand#execute(Model)` calls `Model#clearTracker` to clear the tracker

**Reasons for such implementation**

- This implementation allows for adherence to basic Object Oriented Programming principles

**Possible further implementation**

- add a prompt to check with user whether they really want to clear everything since the command is irreversible

### Non-Functional Requirements

Usability:

- The app should be easy to navigate and use, with a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and clear.
- The app should be accessible to users of different skill levels and backgrounds.
- A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

Reliability:

- The app should be reliable and stable, with minimal downtime or disruptions. It should be able to handle a large number of users and requests without crashing or malfunctioning.
- The app should be able to continue functioning even if a component or service fails, with backup systems or redundancy in place.

Performance:

- The app should respond quickly to user requests, with minimal loading times or delays.
- The app should be able to hold up to 1000 lectures without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

Security:

- The app should be secure, with measures in place to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This may include encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

Scalability:

- The app should be scalable, with the ability to handle an increasing number of users and data as the user base grows.

Compatibility:

- The app should work on any *mainstream OS* as long as it has Java `11` or above installed so that it can be accessed and used by a wide range of users.

Maintainability:

- The app should be easy to maintain and update, with clear and well-organized code, documentation, and version control. This will help ensure that the app remains functional and up-to-date over time.
